# Properly Layout a Website
This document summarizes a video from "The Website Architect", which is linked in the sources section of this document. This document is about properly designing a website layout. This is no UX/UI design document.
## Basic Principals
### Principal #1
Every page is made up of rows, and each row is a separate idea.
Let's breakdown a website layout. In this case we look at https://pixelgamecard.com.

Every row / section pretty much contains one "idea". Usually, there shouldn't be more than just one idea in a row. Implementing two ideas in one section / row will result in a poor user experience and will confuse the user. This is exactly the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. Information on the website should be clear and straight forward to keep up the user's interest.

### Principal #2
Every row should be visually distinguishable from other sections on the page.
If I am being honest, the PixelGameCard website is not the best example. It has some design flaws. One major flaw is that some of the rows barely can be distinguished. Most of the website is just a blank and white page, filled with random text and images.

To sum it up. The background of sections should not be the same twice in a row, unless it's already visually distinct.

What also is possible is that one section can have multiple rows, but only if the content is related to each other. It's more about separating the section, rather than separating the ideas.

When using a light mode, I personally would recommend keeping the background white and switching up to a light grey every other section. In case of a dark mode, you want to use a dark grey instead of a light grey. Primary colors of the color scheme can be used as well, as long it is well distributed throughout the website. Abusing colors can result in the user being confused and overwhelmed as well.

You don't need to have a completely different background for every background, but as long as you can distinguish the sections, then it's all you need.

Another design-related thing to keep in mind in sections is that every section should have some vertical padding on them. The vertical padding should be constant and should not vary too much.
Keeping vertical paddings will make the website more clean and readable.

### Principal #3
You need the content before you lay out a website.

If you want the website to look good, you should avoid working on the layout before planning the content of a website. Instead you should take the content and choose the right layout for that content. The content should come first and the design / layout will reflect that.
## Designing out sections
 Here is an example on how you can lay out your website.

Printerest is a good source to get inspiration. Typing "Web Design Layout", "Web Design" or "Web Design Inspiration" gives you great examples on what you can aim for.

Preparing page elements is also a great way to plan your designs and implement them on your website.
