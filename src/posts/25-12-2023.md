# Permanent Ice Burner Additions / Changes

*These changes are designed to ensure any new permanent Ice Burners do not lose value due to the accessibility and ease of obtaining a piece (Salvatore Solace, Royal Maid, Royal Servant...)*

- Permanent Ice Burner Piece Chance has been decreased to 0.708% (was 2.58%)
- Permanent Ice Burner Pity has been increased to 300 (was 200)
- Permanent Ice Burner will drop their own Crystal (Crystal Ver. Permanent will be discarded)

### Nasod Ariel NPC
After the changes, this NPC will no longer have a use, so it was decided to completely remove it from the game along with its own exchanges.

### Ice Crystalline (Ver. Permanent)
We will stop giving support to this Crystal, however, players will be able to exchange it for any crystal up to this last poll.
(Up to Thanatos)
